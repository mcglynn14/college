            <p class="redcafe-aboutustext">The original Red Cafe Bistro – this is where everything began. Our Glasgow restaurant is the place where our family created and perfected the authentic dining experience that we are famous for today.

                With several menus packed full of traditional dishes, we have secured our place as the favourite, family-friendly restaurant in the Glasgow community.
                
                Our menus and setting provide the perfect atmosphere for any occasion; from romantic meals, to family parties, to graduation celebrations and more. At Red Cafe Glasgow, our friendly staff and stunning decor ensure you’ll feel like one of the family every time you visit.
                
                We can't wait to see you.</p>
