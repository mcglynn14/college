        <p class="slide2-presenttxt">Let’s start talking about the history of html the letters html stands for hypertext markup language 
        html has been developed by 2 groups of organisation the world wide web consortium or w3c for sort and also the web hypertext application technology working group or whatwg for short html was created by Tim Berners lee in 1991 in 2004 w3c closed the 
        development of html whatwg was formed to further develop html there aim was to reflect the 
        modern dynamic web while not to break easting html code in 2005 whatwg 
        gained the support from the major browsers developers in 2008 whatwg released the first public 
        draft of html5 in 2012 w3c and whatwg decided to separate the development of 
        html5 where w3c worked on a definitive standard of html5 and whatwg would 
        work on a living standard  and that’s the history of html</p>
